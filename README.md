# Low-Metallicity Binaries in _Gaia_ DR3

This repository is a companion to the publication "A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries" (Nagarajan et al. 2025). The FEROS and APF spectra analyzed in that work can be found <a href="https://caltech.box.com/s/4j3fh5r3mgu6kj8um2k7lavpt5f8do4z">here</a>. The repository includes a tutorial notebook demonstrating how to read in these spectra.
