# A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries

This repository is a companion to the publication "A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries" (Nagarajan et al. 2025). The FEROS and APF spectra analyzed in that work can be found here. The repository includes a tutorial notebook demonstrating how to read in these spectra.
